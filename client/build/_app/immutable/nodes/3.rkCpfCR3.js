If we cannot extrapolate forecasts into a model of the future, we are ultimately failing to realise the promise of threat intelligence and will inevitably underserve consumers.",j,P,q="The largest systematic evaluation of forecasting performance is the Aggregative Contingent Estimation (ACE) program run by the US Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) from 2010 to 2015.

In theory, there is scope for a LLM consuming text-based information about current events to emulate both the wisdom of the crowd and the analytical processes and dispositions of Tetlock's superforecasters.

When we interact with a system like OpenAI's ChatGPT, inference against the model occurs on a very powerful cloud server in a data center. But it's possible for us to run models on our own hardware - usually called a "local" model - allowing for fine-grained control over a model's behaviour. In particular, we can restrict a LLM's generation so that it matches a specific format. This can be an essential element of programmatically handling the outputs of LLMs and developing applications that go beyond simple chats with human users.

If we sample our language model 100 times on both questions, we get the following distribution of predictions:`,Ee,J,Ke,Ie,ee,Qe="We can see a relatively shapely normal distribution for the Trump 2024 prediction, centered around the 0.20-0.30 likelihood range. The distribution of the data indicates that there is a weak consensus within the model that Trump is unlikely to win the 2024 US election. We can also observe that there is an absolute consensus within the model that there is no chance that a horse will win the 2024 US election. These distributions suggest that there is some cogency to the models' predictions and that it is drawing on contextual training data. We can regard this as proof that the underlying idea is not inherently infeasible - its just a question of how far we can push the accuracy.",Me,te,Ye="But it may be quite a large and difficult question. The Trump prediction is lower than what we might expect given that bookmakers give the scenario approximately even odds of occurring at the time of writing. If we look at the individual predictions made by the model, we can see that all 100 predictions were evenly divisible by 0.1. This strong bias towards round numbers will almost certainly hurt us as we take this project forward - one of Tetlock's observations about high performing forecasters was a tendency towards oddly precise numeric predictions and adjustments on the scale of single percentages.
